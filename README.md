# Phorum

##Concept
Phorum is a photo sharing application centered around events. Phorum allows people at a common event or get together to take and share photos in a common space. 

The center of the Phorum app is the event. There are two types of events, public and private. Public events are large scale events involving hundreds or potentially thousands of participants such as a concert. Public events are not created by users, are open to all, and are location based. (This feature is not yet avaliable) 

The other type of event is a private event. Private events are created by users and are invite only by the creator of the event. Private events are not location based. 

Upon opening the application the user is presented with an easy to use custom camera interface (much like snapchat's camera). The pictures the user takes are then automatically uploaded to the event space they are in. All of the users in the event space are then able to easily see and download the pictures in the event space. 

A primary goal of the application was easy usage. This was achieved through easy account creation with the Fabric Digits API. Furthermore, the UI is easy and intuitive to use through completely custom camera and photo interfaces. 

##Usage
To run the app it needs to be connected with the valid Firebase credentials and valid Fabric credentials. The credentials currently in the repo have been invalidated.
